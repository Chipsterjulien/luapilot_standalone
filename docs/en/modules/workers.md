# `babet.workers` — parallel jobs

Run Lua code on real OS threads. Useful for I/O-bound work that
benefits from concurrency (fetching many URLs, scanning many
files, processing batches) and CPU-bound work on multi-core
hardware.

## Why

Lua has coroutines, but those run cooperatively on a single OS
thread — fine for state machines, not for using multiple cores.
And many tasks are I/O-bound : 100 HTTP requests that each take
500 ms still take 50 s sequentially, but ~500 ms in parallel.

`babet.workers` spawns real OS threads each running their own
isolated Lua state, communicating with the parent via passed-in
arguments and return values. No shared state means no locks,
no data races — just send work in, get results out.

## API

| Function | Returns |
| --- | --- |
| `babet.workers.spawn(code, args?)` | `job` (userdata) \| `(nil, err)` |
| `babet.workers.cpu_count()` | `integer` — number of logical CPUs |
| `job:join(timeout?)` | `(true, result)` \| `(false, err)` \| `(nil, "timeout")` |
| `job:done()` | `boolean` — non-blocking check |
| `job:cancel()` | `(true, nil)` — cooperative ; sets a flag |

### `code` argument

A Lua source string that runs in the worker. The full `babet`
namespace is available, plus a `worker` global with :

- `worker.args` — the second argument passed to `spawn`.
- `worker.cancelled()` — returns `true` if the parent called
  `job:cancel()`. The worker is expected to check this in long
  loops.

The worker's last expression value (or `return value`) is what
`join()` returns as `result`.

### `args` argument

Any value that can be deep-copied between Lua states : `nil`,
booleans, numbers, strings, tables of the same. **Not** : functions,
userdata, threads, tables with cycles. Tables are deep-copied — no
sharing.

## Quick examples

### Parallel HTTP fetches

```lua
local urls = {
    "https://a.example/",
    "https://b.example/",
    "https://c.example/",
    "https://d.example/",
}

local jobs = {}
for i, url in ipairs(urls) do
    jobs[i] = babet.workers.spawn([[
        local url = worker.args.url
        local r, err = babet.http.get(url, { timeout = 10 })
        if not r then return { ok = false, err = err } end
        return { ok = true, status = r.status, length = #r.body }
    ]], { url = url })
end

for i, job in ipairs(jobs) do
    local ok, result = job:join()
    if ok then
        print(i, result.status or result.err)
    else
        print(i, "worker crashed:", result)
    end
end
```

### CPU-bound work with cancellation

```lua
local n = babet.workers.cpu_count()
print("running on", n, "cores")

local jobs = {}
for i = 1, n do
    jobs[i] = babet.workers.spawn([[
        local chunk = worker.args.chunk
        local total = 0
        for x = chunk.from, chunk.to do
            if x % 1000 == 0 and worker.cancelled() then
                return { cancelled = true, partial = total }
            end
            total = total + heavy_compute(x)
        end
        return { total = total }
    ]], { chunk = { from = i * 1000, to = (i + 1) * 1000 - 1 } })
end

-- ... later, if needed:
-- for _, j in ipairs(jobs) do j:cancel() end
```

### Worker pool pattern

```lua
local function map_parallel(items, code, max_concurrent)
    max_concurrent = max_concurrent or babet.workers.cpu_count()
    local results = {}
    local i = 1
    local active = {}

    while i <= #items or next(active) do
        -- launch as many as we can
        while i <= #items and #active < max_concurrent do
            active[#active + 1] = {
                index = i,
                job = babet.workers.spawn(code, { item = items[i] }),
            }
            i = i + 1
        end
        -- harvest any finished
        for k = #active, 1, -1 do
            local entry = active[k]
            if entry.job:done() then
                local ok, result = entry.job:join()
                results[entry.index] = ok and result or { err = result }
                table.remove(active, k)
            end
        end
        if next(active) then babet.sleep(10, "ms") end
    end
    return results
end
```

## Error contract

- **`spawn`** : `(nil, err)` if the OS thread can't be created
  (rare — usually resource limits).
- **`join`** :
  - `(true, result)` — worker completed normally ; `result` is
    its return value (or `nil` if it didn't return).
  - `(false, err)` — worker crashed with an uncaught error ;
    `err` is the error message + traceback.
  - `(nil, "timeout")` — `timeout` elapsed without the worker
    finishing.
- **`cancel`** never fails. The flag is set ; the worker may take
  a while to notice (it must call `worker.cancelled()`).
- **Wrong argument types** → raises via `luaL_error`.

## Sharing data

Workers don't share Lua state. Communication is :

- **In** : via the `args` second argument to `spawn` (deep-copied
  into the worker's state).
- **Out** : via the worker's return value (deep-copied back).
- **Side effects** : a worker can write to a file, append to a
  log, query a database — but coordination through such side
  effects is the script's responsibility.

If two workers write to the same SQLite file, set `wal=true` on
`open` so they don't lock each other out. SQLite handles the
synchronisation correctly with WAL ; in `busy_timeout` you can
configure how long to wait on a busy db.

## Design decisions

- **One Lua state per worker, no sharing**. The alternative —
  shared state with locks — is a well-known source of subtle bugs
  and we don't think Lua-level locks are worth the design effort
  at this layer. Pure message-passing is simpler.
- **No global thread pool**. Each `spawn` creates a fresh OS
  thread, each `join` closes it. For tight loops, build a pool
  in Lua (see example above). The simpler model wins on
  legibility.
- **Cooperative cancellation, not preemptive**. There's no way to
  forcibly stop a Lua thread in the middle of an operation
  without leaving the runtime in an undefined state.
  `worker.cancelled()` returns `true` ; the worker is responsible
  for checking it periodically.
- **`babet.signal` is not available in workers**. Signals are
  process-wide ; only the main thread can sensibly own them.

## Not in v1

- Channels (FIFO queues between workers). Add later if a use
  case shows the pattern is common.
- Shared memory (mmap). Same.
- Async I/O futures (`spawn().then(...)` style). Out of scope ;
  use a polling loop or `done()` checks.
